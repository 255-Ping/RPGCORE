# Master stat reference

> **Status:** Working — stat registry, lore rendering, and aggregation from gear/accessories/status effects all active. `speed`, `ferocity`, and `swing_range` are now wired (rpg-core 1.1.0). **`pristine`** is still defined but not yet wired to gameplay — tracked in [Bugs](planned/todo-bugs.md).

Every stat in the framework. Built-in stats are part of `rpg-api`'s `BuiltinStat` enum so any addon can reference them. Custom stats can be registered at runtime via `StatRegistry.register(new CustomStat(...))`.

Stats marked **percent** display with a `%` suffix and behave as percentage values (e.g., `CRIT_CHANCE: 25` = 25%).

Stats whose owning addon isn't loaded are hidden from menus via per-stat config flags.

## ⚠ Stat IDs ≠ display names

The **ID** column is what you write in YAML. The **Display** column is what players see in item lore. They are often different — use the wrong one and the loader silently drops the stat with a console warning, leaving the player's sheet unchanged.

The two most common mistakes:

| ❌ Wrong (display name) | ✅ Correct (stat ID) |
|---|---|
| `health: 50` | `max_health: 50` |
| `mana: 50` | `max_mana: 50` |

**How to check:** run `/rpg item give <id>` after reload and watch the console. A line like `"item 'X' references unknown stat 'mana'"` means the stat ID is wrong.

## Combat

| ID | Display | Percent | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

## Mobility

| ID | Display | Percent | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `speed` | Speed | no | Walk speed. Formula: `0.1 × (1 + speed × speedPerPoint / 100)` where `speedPerPoint` defaults to `1.0` (config: `stats.speed-per-point`). `speed: 12` → 12% faster. |
| `swing_range` | Swing Range | no | Melee reach in blocks added to the vanilla 3.0 default. Formula: `3.0 + swingRange × blocksPerPoint` (config: `stats.swing-range-per-point`, default `1.0`). `swing_range: 2` → 5.0 block reach. |

## Damage formulas

These are the actual formulas used by `DamageMath.java`. The config YAML can override them — these are the v1 defaults.

### Melee damage

```
after_strength  = base × (1 + strength / 100)
defense_factor  = 1 − defense / (defense + 100)
final           = after_strength × defense_factor

on crit:  final × (1 + crit_damage / 100)
```

`base` = weapon's `damage` stat. `defense` and `true_defense` are the victim's stats (true damage uses `true_defense` instead of `defense`).

### Defense — worked examples

| Defense | Damage reduction | 100 base → dealt |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0% | 100 |
| 50 | 33% | 67 |
| 100 | 50% | 50 |
| 200 | 67% | 33 |
| 300 | 75% | 25 |
| 500 | 83% | 17 |

Diminishing returns — each extra point is worth less. No hard cap.

### Strength — worked examples

| Strength | Multiplier | 100 base → after strength |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ×1.0 | 100 |
| 25 | ×1.25 | 125 |
| 50 | ×1.5 | 150 |
| 100 | ×2.0 | 200 |
| 200 | ×3.0 | 300 |

Linear — every point of strength is worth the same.

### Full worked example

> Player: `strength 80`, weapon: `damage 120`, vs mob: `defense 100`, `crit_damage 50`

```
after_strength  = 120 × (1 + 80/100)  = 120 × 1.80 = 216
defense_factor  = 1 − 100/(100+100)   = 0.50
normal hit      = 216 × 0.50          = 108 damage
crit hit        = 108 × (1 + 50/100)  = 162 damage
```

### Stat budgets per tier

Rough guidelines for authoring balanced gear. Adjust to suit your server's XP curve.

| Tier | Example zone | Weapon `damage` | Player `strength` | Player `defense` | Mob HP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | Tutorial area | 30–60 | 0–20 | 0–30 | 80–250 |
| Early | First content zone | 80–150 | 20–60 | 30–80 | 300–800 |
| Mid | Mid-game zones | 150–350 | 60–150 | 80–200 | 800–3,000 |
| Late | Late-game zones | 350–800 | 150–350 | 200–500 | 3,000–15,000 |
| End | Boss / endgame | 800–2,000 | 350–600 | 400–800 | 15,000–100,000 |

Use the worked example formula to sanity-check any gear set before shipping.

## Stat sources

A `StatHolder` (player or mob) aggregates stats from:

- Base stats (set by the entity at creation)
- Equipped items (armor slots, main/off hand)
- Accessories in the accessory bag (only the highest of each `accessory.id` counts by default; configurable)
- Active status effects (positive or negative modifiers, duration-bound)
- Skill milestones (per-level bonuses)
- Guild perks
- Region buffs (set by region flag)

Modifier resolution order (configurable): `flat → percent → multiplicative`.
